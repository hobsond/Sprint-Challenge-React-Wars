its a java script frame work that allows you to seperate a website into components and allows you to build components
and also reusable components and creates a virtual dom.

1. Describe component state.
State allows you to save current data in a component when that state updates the dom re renders only on that property

Props is information that can be passed down from component to component 

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?
side effects control when the useEffect will happen the useEffect will render initially when the dom is loaded 
but you can pass and array as the second argument of the useEffect with the item you want the useEffect to activate
when said item changes.
